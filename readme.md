## Yo, Yeoman.io!

The development environment and build system are generated by [generator-jekyllrb](https://github.com/robwierzbowski/generator-jekyllrb). For development, build, and deploy instructions see the [usage section in the generator's README](https://github.com/robwierzbowski/generator-jekyllrb/blob/a6b7f84df446378195b9b638509c5d7890fa130d/README.md#grunt-workflow).
