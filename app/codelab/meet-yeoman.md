# Meet Yeoman

Yeoman is a man in a hat with tricks up his sleeve.

With just a command or two, Yeoman can write boilerplate code for your entire web application or individual pieces like Controllers and Models. Yeoman can fire up a preview web server and watch your files for edits in order to live reload changes and compile your Sass. Yeoman can also run your unit tests, minimize and concatenate your code, optimize images, plus more!

* [**yo**](http://yeoman.io) is a scaffolding tool that offers an ecosystem of framework-specific scaffolds, called generators, that can be used to perform some of the tedious tasks mentioned earlier.

Yeoman also works with other tools for improving your productivity:

* [**grunt**](http://gruntjs.com) is used to build, preview, and test your project, thanks to help from tasks curated by the Yeoman team and [grunt-contrib](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib).

* [**gulp**](http://gulpjs.com/) is an alternative to GruntJS that favors code over configuration.

* [**bower**](http://bower.io) is used for dependency management, so that you no longer have to manually download your front-end libraries.

You can install Yeoman generators using the [npm](http://npmjs.org) command and there are over [500 generators](http://yeoman.io/generators) now available, many of which have been written by the open-source community. Popular generators include [generator-angular](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular), [generator-backbone](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-backbone), and [generator-ember](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-ember).


## Why use Yeoman?

With so many great tools available to front-end web developers these days it can sometimes be difficult to understand how they all fit together. Deciding on a workflow that you’re happy with is often a very personal endeavour, but getting started isn’t always easy. Yeoman aims to solve this problem by scaffolding workflows for creating modern webapps, while at the same time mixing in many of the best practices that have evolved within the industry.
