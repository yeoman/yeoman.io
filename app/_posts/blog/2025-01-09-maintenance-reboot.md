## A Look Back at Yeoman

Yeoman (or "yo") has been a cornerstone of web development tooling for over a decade.  

First released in 2012 by the Chrome DevRel team, Yeoman provides a robust workflow and tools for managing templates, known as ‚Äúgenerators.‚Äù Its iconic top-hat logo has become one of the most recognizable symbols in open-source development. üé©‚ù§Ô∏è  

In its heyday, Yeoman introduced developers to powerful ways of generating project templates, paving the way for tools like [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev). Though no longer at the cutting edge of web tooling, Yeoman remains a valuable resource for developers seeking a stable and proven solution.


## Why Relaunch Maintenance?

Yeoman has always been a community-driven project. Over the years, it has gone through cycles of active development and quieter periods, depending on the availability of volunteer maintainers.  

Yeoman is still actively used by many projects such as [JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech) and [VS Code's extension development starter](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension).
After some sporadic updates in recent years, we‚Äôre now prioritizing stability, ensuring Yeoman can remain a dependable tool for legacy projects and those who continue to benefit from its features.  


## Maintenance Goals for 2025

The focus for this maintenance phase is **stability, not feature development**. With limited resources, we aim to address core issues and improve the experience for both contributors and users. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs on our roadmap:

### Core Priorities

- **Tidy Up Backlogs**  
  Triage outstanding issues and pull requests across Yeoman‚Äôs repositories.  
- **Documentation and Tooling Updates**  
  Modernize contributing guidelines and development practices to make it easier for others to get involved.  
- **Dependency Updates**  
  Upgrade dependencies, replacing deprecated packages as necessary.  
- **Bug Fixes**  
  Release quality-of-life updates to resolve outstanding issues and improve platform support.  


## What‚Äôs Next?

Here‚Äôs a sneak peek at what‚Äôs coming soon:

1. **Governance and Security**  
   We‚Äôre formalizing governance and security processes to ensure long-term sustainability.  
2. **Public Communication**  
   We‚Äôll launch a Discord community and update the Yeoman website to reflect current priorities.  
3. **Better Contribution Flows**  
   Updated labels, tooling, and workflows will make it easier for contributors to engage with the project.  
4. **Testing Releases**  
   We‚Äôll publish some non-feature releases to test our updated pipelines.  

For more details, see the [full announcement on GitHub](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/issues/1779).


## Scope of Work

Our primary focus will be on maintaining key Yeoman projects like `yo`, `generator-generator`, and `yeoman-test`, among others. At the same time, some older, less relevant projects will be deprecated to streamline maintenance.  

For a full list of the repositories in scope, check out our maintenance plan on [GitHub issue #1779](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/issues/1779).  


## A Word on Finances

Thanks to our supporters, Yeoman has funds held through [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/yeoman). While we don‚Äôt plan to allocate these funds immediately, they‚Äôll support the project‚Äôs future sustainability, including through platforms like Tidelift.
