title: How Yeoman is Enhancing Security Through Policy Updates
---

This is just the start. We're also working on a **deeper security initiative** to strengthen Yeoman for the long haul. If you're curious or want to contribute, check out the discussion [here "Yeoman issue: Reboot Security ðŸ”’"](https://github.com/yeoman/.github/issues/1).

---
We're not just dusting off old code. As part of our **[Maintenance Reboot Initiative](https://yeoman.io/blog/maintenance-reboot)**, we're rebuilding Yeoman for the futureâ€”stronger, faster, and definitely more secure. 

Thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve rolled out an updated **[Security Policy](https://github.com/yeoman/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md)** to keep our ecosystem locked down tight. If you're into open source (and we know you are), here's how you can help keep Yeoman secure.

## How to Report a Vulnerability (Without Blowing Up the Internet)

- **Found something shady?**  
  - **Step 1:** **Do NOT open a public issue!** 
  - **Step 2:** Report it privately through [GitHub Security Advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).  
  - **Step 3:** Canâ€™t use GitHub? Check the [security policy](https://github.com/yeoman/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md) for an alternative option.

Why private? Because public issues can give attackers a head start, and weâ€™re not here for that.

## What Happens After?

- You'll hear from us within **few days** (we're fast, but coffee breaks exist).  
- We aim to squash confirmed vulnerabilities within **30 days**â€”complex issues might take a bit longer.  
- Youâ€™ll be looped in throughout the process. Transparency is key.  
- Once fixed, weâ€™ll shout out your name (if you want) as a thank-you!

## Rewards? Not Yet. Recognition? Absolutely.

No, thereâ€™s no bug bounty (for now). But responsible disclosures get you serious street cred in the Yeoman community. Weâ€™ll acknowledge your contributions (with your consent) after a fix is out. 


**Happy hacking ðŸŽ©**
