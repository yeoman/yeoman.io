#Getting Started

  <h2><span class="step">STEP 1:</span> INSTALL ME</h2>
  <p>Open up a terminal and enter in the following:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
  $ curl <a href='https://raw.github.com/yeoman/yeoman/master/setup/install.sh'>https://raw.github.com/yeoman/yeoman/master/setup/install.sh</a> | sh
  </pre>
  <p>This will immediately install Yeoman and any dependencies it may need such as Node, NPM and Ruby.</p>

  <p><strong>Please note that Yeoman requires <a href="http://nodejs.org/download/">Node 0.8.x </a>in order to correctly function.</strong></p>

  <h2><span class="step">STEP 2:</span> CREATE A NEW PROJECT</h2>
  <p>Next, enter in yeoman init followed by the name of the directory you would like to scaffold your application in.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
  $ yeoman init myapp
  </pre>
    <p>If a directory isn't supplied, we'll infer a name based on the directory you're in at the moment.</p>
    <h2><span class="step">STEP 3:</span> PROFIT</h2>
    <p>We'll then ask you some questions to help scaffold your project out. Simple!</p>
